The application I created is about buying spectacles.
First to enter the application enter any character or to quit the application enter ‘q’
Then the applications asks you to enter the amount you have and gives you the types of frames you can buy with the amount
Then application prompts you to enter your name 
Then application prompts you to enter your eye sight
Then application prompts you to enter the frame you want
Then application gives the amount that costs for the frame you choose and then displays the details with the remaining amount present in your pocket
Then prompts to enter a character or ‘q’ to quit
If you enter any character it takes you through the above steps again or if you enter ‘q’ then it shows you “done” and quits from the application.
